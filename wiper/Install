my wiper is not mounted to the xy joint it is mounted on the x extrusion so it clears the z joints and you can place it where you need it.
And you can easily customise the cad to make it fit your usecase (expand it shorten it how you want) 
glue the wiper material in the back and make it how you need it that it is resting on it
then make a hole in your wiper material in the front and screw it in so it doesnt move 
if you want you can install a extra piece on the side as extra wiper to make sure nothing is on your nozzle
