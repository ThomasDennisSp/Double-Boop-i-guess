# Double-Boop?
A Double Boop version which i made for use on the Frankenvoron Tridex (https://github.com/FrankenVoron/Tridex) so you can use the mini sb on a frontmounted mgn12h

it is based on boop a mini sb version of tap which the printers for ants team (https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Boop) made for the mgn9h rail printers and the base of the model is from Khay (https://github.com/khay8485/Quaduck-beta) of the community

it works with the standalone sensors best but it also works with the tap pcb but you need to remove 1 ear of it and i dont know if it works with versions other than the v1 pcb as i only have those
your wiper arms NEED to be removed or you need to install the wipers i made
